# Phishing Playbook

**Phishing Playbook** â€“ a hands-on, evolving resource for investigating phishing emails. This project is both a personal training ground and a practical guide for aspiring defenders.\


### :pushpin: Purpose:&#x20;

This playbook is created to make **phishing email analysis a daily habit** â€“ not just a skill, but a reflex. Every incident becomes an opportunity to sharpen detection, investigation, and response skills.

The goal was to create a repo that will walk you through the full analysis lifecycle â€” manual and automated.\

### :tophat: Whatâ€™s Inside:&#x20;

#### Core Goals:

* Master **manual** and **automated** phishing analysis
* Learn to **think like an attacker**, act like a **defender**
* Drill every day until response becomes instinct
* Build your **tool arsenal** and keep it sharp
* Keep operations **safe**, **clean**, and **documented**



### :toolbox: Tools Used (growing list)

This playbook will feature a living library of tools, including:

* Email headers analyzers
* Sandboxing environments
* CyberChef
* VirusTotal
* Thunderbird
* CLI tools
* Wireshark\
  ...and more as we grow.



### :clapper: Process Overview

Each phishing analysis follows a full-stack approach:

1. **Environment Prep**
   * Isolated Virtual Machine setup
   * Tools installation
   * Safety configurations
2. **Email Acquisition**
   * From honeypot or shared repositories
   * Defanged and isolated
3. **Initial Inspection**
   * Header analysis
   * URL/IP extraction
   * Attachment triage
4. **Deobfuscation & Payload Analysis**
   * String decoding
   * Malware static/dynamic analysis
   * C2 infrastructure detection
5. **Reporting & Clean-up**
   * IOC documentation (that's what need to be added)
   * Cleaning and resetting VM
   * Secure disposal of samples



### :question: Who This Is For

* Aspiring SOC analysts
* Cybersecurity students
* Self-taught defenders
* Anyone who wants to learn phishing analysis **from scratch**

No experience? No problem. This playbook explains **what to do**, **why it matters**, and **how to improve** over time.



### :honey\_pot: Coming Soon: Honeypot

I am about to set up a custom **honeypot** to collect real phishing samples in a controlled environment. This will feed the playbook with fresh, real-world emails.
